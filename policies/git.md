# Git + PR discipline

## PR-everywhere

**All repos go through PRs**, including `specs/` (ADRs, concept docs). No direct-to-main pushes. This reverses the previous "Specs/main workflow vs services PR workflow" split documented in the legacy `exercir-workbench/.claude/agent-workflow.md` §6.4.

## Verifier wave

Every non-trivial PR (new endpoint, schema migration, multi-component UI feature, cross-pack contract change) gets the verifier wave **in parallel** before merging (four agents always; `exercir-charter-checker` joins on `domains/exercir/` PRs):

- `local-ci` — build + test + lint + PHI scan
- `reviewer` — adversarial code review + architecture-drift detection
- `charter-checker` — substrate constitution (ring boundaries, the four kernel concerns, the ADR-176 inclusion test, "store generators, derive graphs")
- `qa-engineer` — cross-cutting (coverage, a11y, perf, observability, ring-ownership + scalability, contract drift, doc completeness)
- `exercir-charter-checker` — Exercir product prototype-charter (demo-mode, sandbox deps, no-real-PHI); exercir-domain PRs only

All applicable agents dispatched in one message with multiple tool calls, all using `isolation: "worktree"`. Disagreement escalates to the founder. See `workflows/verifier-wave.md` for details.

## Hard rules

- **Never `--no-verify`.** Pre-push hooks (PHI scanner, secret scanner) are the only gates between work and the remote when GHA is frozen. Fix the underlying issue if a hook fails; do not bypass.
- **Never force-push to `main`/`master`.** Force-push to feature branches is OK only when explicitly authorized.
- **Never amend a commit after a hook failed.** The hook failure means the commit didn't happen; `--amend` modifies the PREVIOUS commit and can destroy work. Re-stage and create a NEW commit.
- **Don't bundle unrelated changes** in one commit or PR.

## Commit messages

- Imperative mood ("add X", "fix Y", not "added X", "fixed Y").
- First line ≤ 72 characters.
- Body explains *why*, not *what* (the diff shows what).
- Co-authored-by trailers for AI-assisted commits per the team convention.

## PR body — Effect declarations (optional, non-gating)

When a PR carries a *forward prediction* about a measurable delivery indicator, declare it in the body so `pack-devloop` can calibrate the predictor over time. This is an [ADR-193](../layers/specs/adr/adr-193-pack-devloop-effect-declarations-are-calibratable-claims.md) **calibratable claim — never a merge gate**: declarations are optional, observed-vs-declared is logged not enforced, a missing or wrong declaration never blocks a PR, and it scores the *predictor's* calibration (the producer), not compliance.

One line per declared effect:

```text
Effect: <indicatorId> <predicted>±<sd> [basis]
```

- `<indicatorId>` — e.g. `cycle-time`. **Today only `cycle-time` is auto-observed** (review latency in hours, derived from the merge timestamps); other indicators are captured but won't score until a metric source is wired into `pack-devloop`.
- `<predicted>±<sd>` — point estimate and 1σ uncertainty (separator `±`, `+/-`, or `+-`). The score is a proper rule: an over-tight wrong interval is penalised, but so is a vague wide one — sharpness *and* accuracy both count, so state an honest `sd`.
- `[basis]` — optional provenance: `literature | expert | tenant | derived | sham` (defaults to `derived`).

Example (a PR expected to merge quickly):

```text
Effect: cycle-time 6±2 expert
```

**Orchestrator:** include an `Effect:` line whenever you can make a defensible prediction about a self-observed indicator (today: `cycle-time`); omit it rather than guess wildly. An empty or reflexive declaration teaches readers to ignore the field.

## Branches

- Feature branches off `main`. Squash-merge to `main` via PR.
- Per-story branches named `feat/<short-slug>` or `fix/<short-slug>`.
